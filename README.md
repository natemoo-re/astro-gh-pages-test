# [Astro](https://astro.build) GitHub Pages Template

## ðŸ¤– Automatic Deployment to GitHub Pages

This minimal Astro project template comes with a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that automatically deploys your site to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

For more information, see the GitHub Pages guide for [Publishing with a custom GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) and the [`withastro/action`](https://github.com/withastro/action#readme) repository.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
